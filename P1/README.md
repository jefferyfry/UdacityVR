Liked: I have done a little bit of VR Unity development, but never actually built a runtime application. Setting up Android Studio and the SDK to quickly build and deploy an APK to the phone is pretty cool.

Challenging: Reading through the UdacityFunEffects script to understand the code was a little challenging.
